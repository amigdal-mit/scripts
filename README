ansible:
  Ansible configuration for LVS directors and syslog servers (and
  hopefully everything else, in the future)

host:
  files needed to set up a scripts.mit.edu hypervisor (aka VM host)

server:
  files needed to run a scripts.mit.edu server (aka realserver)

ldap:
  files needed to run a scripts.mit.edu ldap server (aka scripts-ldap)

  ldap servers were previously run on realservers. However, 16-way MMR
  turns out to be difficult to manage. By splitting the LDAP cluster
  into its own servers, Scripts migrations across version boundaries
  are easier since there is not a cutover period to two different
  versions of LDAP in the pool. However, this is still true when
  upgrading the LDAP cluster itself.

  The LDAP cluster should be run on a variant of EL to reduce
  maintenance burden.
