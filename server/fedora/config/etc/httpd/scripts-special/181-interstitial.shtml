    <p><em>This is a message from the scripts.mit.edu team to the owner of <!--#echo var="SERVER_NAME" -->.  If you are not the owner, please pass this message along to them.  (They should have received a copy by email.)</em></p>

    <hr />

    <p><!--#echo var="SERVER_NAME" --> is currently connected to the Scripts server via a DNS A record for 18.181.0.46.  As a result of IS&T selling a large portion of MIT’s IPv4 address space to Amazon, we have been forced to migrate the Scripts server to a new address.  To keep <!--#echo var="SERVER_NAME" --> working, you must update your DNS records to follow this migration.</p>

    <p>Specifically: <strong>you need to update this A record from the old address ‘18.181.0.46’ to the new address ‘18.4.86.46’.</strong></p>

    <p>Alternatively, you may be able to replace the A record with a CNAME record for ‘scripts-vhosts.mit.edu.’, keeping in mind the <a href="https://scripts.mit.edu/faq/14">caveats noted in our FAQ</a>.</p>

    <p>These changes must be made with your domain registrar or external DNS provider.  There is no need to respond to this notice or otherwise contact the Scripts team.</p>

    <p>(The Scripts team does not control your DNS and cannot make the updates for you.  While we may be able to provide advice on a best-effort volunteer basis, keep in mind that we are sending similar notices regarding nearly 300 hostnames, so responses, if any, may be delayed.)</p>

    <p>Both the old and new addresses are functional at present, but you must change to the new address by <strong>June 12</strong>: at that point, the old address 18.181.0.46 will stop pointing to Scripts and might be repurposed by some arbitrary Amazon cloud customer.</p>

    <p>We apologize for any inconvenience.</p>
